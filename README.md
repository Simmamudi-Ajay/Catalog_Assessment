# Shamir's Secret Sharing Implementation

This project solves a simplified version of **Shamir's Secret Sharing** using **Lagrange Interpolation** to find the constant term `c` of a polynomial. It decodes the polynomial's encoded roots (given in various number bases) and determines the secret constant using a set of at least `k` decoded points. The project reads a JSON file for input and outputs the secret constant term.
