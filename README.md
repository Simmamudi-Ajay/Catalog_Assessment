This project solves a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing using Lagrange Interpolation to find the constant term c of a polynomial. It decodes the polynomial's encoded roots (given in various number bases) and determines the secret constant using a set of at least k decoded points. The project reads a JSON file for input and outputs the secret constant term.
